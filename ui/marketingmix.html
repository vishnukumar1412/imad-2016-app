	<p>
	First we develop a product, secondly the product should easily available to the customer, thirdly fix the price aptly, finally introduce the product so that customer get attracted to the product and buy repeatedly.<br><br>
	<b>Product</b><br>
	Quality should not be compromised. Eventhough you market product attractively,low price, and made easily available to the customer they buy the product for one time only because Quality is compromised.<br><br>
	<b>Place</b><br>
	Product should be available nook and corner of your decided circle or throughout the country.Sales relies on availability of the product in the market.Even rural people can able to buy the product.<br><br>
	<b>Price</b><br>
	Before fixing price you should decide whether you target low & middle class people or elite people.Based on the selected category the price should be matched so that customer can buy product.you should make research on buying power of each category people so that fixing price becomes easy.<br><br>
	<b>Promotion</b><br>
	Promotion plays a vital role in the marketing mix.It only talks to the people about your product.You product is nice quality,low price and easily available in shops but people don't know about your product means total failure.So advertisement should be attractive and explains unique feature.<br>
	Product success/failure depends on Marketing Mix.keep the customer in mind while you design marketing mix.<br>
