		<b>What is Marketing?</b><br>
		Identify the customer problem/needs, solve them and make them happy than the competitor.<br>
		There are four factor which influence marketing.we explain one by one.<br><br>
		<b>Customer</b><br>
		If marketing is a religion then customer is a God.<br>Who is a Customer?<br>
		a person buying product? or a person make others to buy? or a person making decision to buy the product? or a person who use the product?<br>
		All of them is a customer.
		we see with a example to make better understand..father buys a ice cream for his child..here who is a customer?....Both of them...shop owner should attract the child as well as father to buy ice cream if he fails to attract any of them then he would lose one sales.<br><br>
		<b>Requirement</b><br>
		If a customer needs a motor bike you can ask i can take it as a requirement .the answer is no.before invention of motor bike if a person wants to go to the destination quickly then that would be a requirement.<br><br>
		<b>Competitor</b><br> 
		If competitor doesn't exist then world would not attain development as of now.Before dive into a business you should know all the competitor and their strength.competitor is not only who manufacture same product like you but also who solve the same problem as you do. for example..for car manufacturer the competitor is not just other car manufacturers but all the manufacturers involved in automobile sector.<br><br>
		<b>Entertainer</b><br>
		Solving the problem is the basic requirement expected by a customer and added to that make the customer happy is the key to success.
